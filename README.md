# Coop-Crystalis
1) Download folder from github link. https://github.com/TheSirArchibald/Coop-Crystalis

2) Download Hamachi. https://vpn.net/  (This will allow up to get around people not having access to their routers for port forwarding) 

3) Allow Hamachi App access through your firewall. PM me if you need help. 
Note I allowed all 4 of these .exe files but all may not be required.

4) Create/join a network in Hamachi. Share info with other players.
Ex. IP = 25.64.29.180 PORT = 2620

5) Launch Emuhawk.exe in the V2 folder.  Note Bizhawk Core has to be NesHawk along with Lua+Lua Interface.

6) Open Lua console and add coop.lua file

7) Run Lua and either start the server or join your friends.

8) Note Emotracker (Auto Variants) can be used with Coop mode only if you update EmoTracker's Connectors for 2.9 Bizhawk (C:\Program Files (x86)\EmoTracker\Connectors\bizhawk). My set of 2.9 Connectors does include a 2.8.1 bypass; this is to account for Crystalis coop being valid only for the 2.8.1 core. Refer here for inital Emotracker Connector download if you have any issues. https://en-minish-cap.deoxis9001.ovh/tracking.html
