# Coop-Crystalis
1) Download newest github link. https://github.com/TheSirArchibald/Coop-Crystalis

2) Download Hamachi. https://vpn.net/  (This will allow up to get around people not having access to their routers for port forwarding) 

3) Allow Hamachi App access through your firewall. PM me if you need help. 
Note I allowed all 4 of these .exe files but all may not be required.

4) Create/join a network in Hamachi. Share info with other players.
Ex. IP = 25.64.29.180 PORT = 2620

5) Launch Emuhawk.exe in the V2 folder  (Note I would recommend starting just outside of the cyrotube when starting the lua script).  Note Bizhawk Core has to be NesHawk. 

6) Open Lua console and add coop.lua file

7) Run Lua and either start the server or join your friends.
